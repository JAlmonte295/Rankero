## Introduction

As someone who is indecisive and always craves to try the best stuff first, I often find myself visiting "best of" list sites or asking people close to me for their opinions. Rankero was born from this idea, aiming to provide a simple and fun platform for creating, sharing, and discovering community-driven ranked lists on any topic imaginable.

This project was built to explore modern front-end development with React, including state management with Context, client-side routing, and creating a polished, responsive user interface that communicates with a back-end API. The result is a dynamic and interactive experience with a fun incentive rating/voting system that I plan to further develop in the future.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality using JWT tokens.
- **Create & Manage Ranks**: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own ranked lists.
- **Interactive Voting**: Users can upvote or downvote ranks and the individual items within them.
- **Dynamic Categories**: Ranks are organized by categories, each with a unique, dynamically generated color for easy identification.
- **Commenting System**: Users can leave comments on ranks to share their opinions.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Search**: A debounced search bar allows users to find ranks instantly as they type.
